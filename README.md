## Analysis of Multi-Omics dataset using machine learning approach to identify biomarkers related to Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).


# Background

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is a silent condition not causing any specific symptoms until they
have developed advanced liver disease. NAFLD is caused by accumulation of fat in the liver and can
lead to more aggressive stages- hepatocellular carcinoma. It is Identified by ultrasound or blood test.
NAFLD effect quarter of the global population.

# Knowledge gap

Exact pathophysiology of the disease is not known and hence in this project we aim to integrate and
quantify the interactions between gene expression and lipidomic data within 
NAFLD cohort.

# Methods and datasets

We will obtain the dataset from public resources like GEO, TCGA or Omicsdi data. Further we will
pre-process and normalize the dataset for downstream marker analysis. We will use machine learning
model like: Random Forest and will be validated on test set. Those markers will be
used for integration and visualized. To add biological insight, we will add enrichment analysis and
literature validation.
